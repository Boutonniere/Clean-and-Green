                   <P>Healthy ecosystems maintain our soil, clean our air, control the climate, recycle nutrients, and give us food. They 
        offer resources. Humans rely heavily on nature, which is a phrase that includes both living things and the factors 
        that shape the natural world, including the weather, mountains, oceans, and landscapes. Even city inhabitants in 
        contemporary skyscrapers require nature's gifts of air to breathe, water to drink, and food to consume in order to 
        survive. While ready-to-eat foods and bottled water are available at supermarkets, they were not made there. Certain 
        fruits and vegetables, for instance, can only be grown in tropical regions and must travel the world in chilled 
        shipping containers to reach your local store at the perfect time of ripeness. As humans do not now possess the 
        capacity to produce significant quantities of water in a laboratory, all drinking water ultimately originates from a 
        natural source.</P>
