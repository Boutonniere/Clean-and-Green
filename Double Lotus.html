            <h6>All About Kate</h6>
            </br>
            <p> My name is Jean Michell P. Manuel, l was born and raised in Batangas but l moved to Cavite eleven years ago. I am a engineering student at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines-Alfonso Campus. I lives in Indang, Cavite. When l know who l am, l know what l need to do, instead of looking for permission from others to do what l already know l ought to do. Once l know myself become more confident will understand my purpose, and l will begin making a bigger impact on the world. Here are the five steps to know to myself.
              <br/>
              <p>First, l love sport particular chess. Sport is an athletic activity requiring not only skill or physical prowess but also intelligence. Chess l think is the most challenging sport ever. Soccer is amazing to me, but it takes a lot more skill. When l first started it wasn't aggressive at all. But now, it almost feels football.
                <br/>
              Second, My sense of humor. A sense of humor refers to the ability to find things funny, general enjoyment in doing so, or the particular types of things one finds funny, general enjoyment in doing so, or the particular types of things one finds funny have a good, healthy sense of humor. Meaning l have the ability to laugh at myself, as well as find the irony in a lot of situations. Even when l may be stuck in a frustrating situation, l can still usually find something to laugh .For instance, if my friend give me wrong appointment when l meet them l prefer to laugh than to get angry.
              <br/>
              Third, l can eat same food day-in-day. Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. Food is usually of animal or plant origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamin, or minerals. It's important to me to eat a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, in as many different colors as possible loaded with vitamins and minerals, eating a salad a day will also increase the level of powerful antioxidants in my blood. The basis of any salad, leafy greens, offers a huger nutritional benefit. I can eat same food for lunch, and dinner everyday. And keep my weight. </p>
              <br/>
              <P>Also, am passionate about my studies. Being a passionate person is to be motivated by your emotions, whether they storm from anger, disgust, sadness, fear, or joy. It is something l feels strongly about at this point in my life. Am passionate about my studies because l love what l do, l have a steady source of my best. In my job, this passion led me to challenge myself everyday and learn new skills and knowledge that helped me to do better work. 
              Finally, my goal for future. A goal is an idea of the future or desired result that a person or a group of people envision, plan and commit to achieve.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>To summarize, am happy about being who l am. It is true that l am not perfect just like anybody else. However, l will do everything to make myself proud, and happy. Love sport, have sense of humor, eat same food day-to-day, have passionate about school, and goal for my future are some steps about myself that are very important to me.
