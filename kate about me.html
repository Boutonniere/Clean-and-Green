            <h6>All About Kate</h6>
            <p>My name is Kate Mahinay, my friends calls me Kate. I was an accidental child, I was created after the Valentines. They say I am a miracle child since I almost died after my mother gave birth to me. I live somewhere in Cavite. I got a lot cats, they’re my life. I am self proclaimed ambivert, which means I enjoy being surrounded by people and being alone. </p>
            <p>I used to play sports as a hobby nor compliance. I used to play basketball, sepak takraw, badminton, swimming, and arnis. Those sports mentioned are not for me, I realized. I am not sporty, I don’t excel on one specific thing. I only know how to play them but I am not good at it. I love watching sports. Reading articles about them. Getting hype on my favorite team. And talking about them with my friends. </p>
            <p>I’m a nice, fun, and friendly but I can be the most complicated person you’ve ever met. I’m nice to the nice people. One thing about me that is important to know though is that at first I look as a very arrogant person but once I get to know people and are comfortable with my environment I am great. I joke, laugh and humor people and I also get as much as I give. I am a very kind, compassionate, sensitive as my close friends will tell you. I have a tough shell but on the inside I am soft. I am also a very principled person and stand strong on what is right and wrong. I am also a very straight and honest person. I understand and know that we all put on a show sometimes and do not show who we really are or what we feel but some people do this constantly and those kinds of people I cannot stand.</p>
            <p>Academically I am a student who likes to be mentally challenged and I enjoy both hands on projects as well as conventional learning but most of the time, my mind are on other dimension. I am an enthusiastic potato head student and I love to cram all the time. I also enjoy english but enjoy procrastination the most! Last year, I enjoy the lessons as it is often different from other lessons but yet as meaningful. It provides you with great insight on many things one does not normally think about but I don’t enjoy the teacher as it is.</p>
